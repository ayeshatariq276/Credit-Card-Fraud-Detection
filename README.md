 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Data Science & AI

**Introduction**
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence techniques**. The objective is to analyze transaction data, identify suspicious patterns, and build intelligent models capable of classifying transactions as **fraudulent** or **non-fraudulent**.

The project was developed as part of the **Data Science & AI course** and follows a **week-by-week structured methodology**, covering the complete lifecycle of a data science project—from data exploration to explainability, ethics, and deployment concepts.

## Project Objectives
 
* Understand and preprocess credit card transaction data
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Apply supervised learning models for fraud detection
* Use unsupervised learning to identify hidden patterns
* Conceptually apply Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
* Evaluate models using appropriate performance metrics
* Explain model predictions (Explainable AI)
* Address ethical considerations in financial AI systems
* Present an end-to-end project pipeline

 Methodology
The project follows a structured and systematic workflow:

1. **Data Understanding & Exploration**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)**
5. **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)**
6. **Model Evaluation & Comparison**
7. **Explainability & Ethical Analysis**
8. **Deployment Concept**
9. **Final Documentation & Reporting**

 Models Applied

* **Logistic Regression** – Baseline, interpretable classifier
* **Random Forest Classifier** – Ensemble model for improved performance
* **Linear Regression** – Transaction amount prediction
* **K-Means Clustering** – Unsupervised pattern discovery
* **Artificial Neural Network (Conceptual)** – Advanced fraud detection approach
Each model was evaluated to understand its strengths, limitations, and suitability for fraud detection.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC Curve and AUC

**Recall** was identified as the most important metric due to the high cost of missed fraud cases.

Explainability & Ethics
The project includes a dedicated section on **Explainable AI**, explaining:

* Why a transaction is classified as fraud or non-fraud (X → Y)
* Feature influence on predictions
* Transparency in financial AI systems

## Ethical considerations addressed include:

* Bias and fairness
* False positives impact
* Data privacy and confidentiality
* Responsible AI usage
  
## Deployment 

The deployment phase is explained conceptually, covering:

* End-to-end fraud detection pipeline
* Model integration with transaction systems
* Real-time fraud risk scoring
* Alert generation mechanisms

This demonstrates how the model can be applied in real-world financial environments.
